=Methods=

After running the test, you can call several methods on the test object. 
In order to call these methods, you need to variablize your call to a new instance of enhance(), like this:
{{{
	var myEnhancements = new enhance();
	//call a method
	myEnhancements.forceFail();
}}}	
	
The following methods can be called post-test:

===forceFail===
  * type: function
  * description: Set cookie value to fail and refresh page.

===forcePass===
  * type: function
  * description: Set cookie value to pass and refresh page.
	
===reTest===
  * type: function
  * description: Delete cookie and refresh page (re-run test)
